                <p> <em> Vietnamese food is distinct and unforgettable.</em>
                Spread across street-side vendors and high-end restaurants, typical Vietnamese food tastes salty, sweet, sour and hot.
                 These flavours are achieved through using nuoc mam, which is a fermented fish sauce. Cane sugar, the juice of kalamansi citrus fruit or tamarind and chilli peppers are also added. 
                 Dishes use plenty of fresh herbs but tend not to be overly spicy, as chilli sauces are served separately.</p>

                        Goi Cuon (spring rolls)

                        <p> 
                        Goi Cuon are translucent spring rolls packed with greens, coriander and minced pork or shrimp. A southern variation has barbecued strips of pork wrapped up with green banana and star fruit, and then dunked in a rich peanut sauce – every bit as tasty as it sounds.

                        Served cold, Goi Cuon are usually served as a starter before a main course at Vietnamese restaurants. If you travel to northern Vietnam then you may find that they're referred to as Nem Cuon. Whatever they're called, they're certainly delicious!

                       <p>
                        These enormous, cheap and filling Vietnamese pancakes contains shrimp, pork, bean sprouts and egg. They are fried, wrapped in rice paper with greens and dunked in a fish sauce (Nuoc Cham) before eaten.

                       <p>
                        The best city to try Banh xeo (or "sizzling pancake") is Ho Chi Minh City. But it's also one of those snacks that you should stock up on if you're travelling by train or bus – the perfect accompaniment for those long journeys.

                        The country’s great staple dish is Pho (pronounced “fuh”). This noodle soup can be eaten at any time of day but is primarily eaten at breakfast. It originated in the north of the country but is now a national dish of Vietnam. A bowl of Pho consists of a light beef or chicken broth flavoured with ginger and coriander, to which are added broad, flat rice noodles and spring onions. Meat-wise, slivers of chicken, pork or beef are then added. Tofu is the main vegetarian option.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Pho in Vietnam can be found on almost every menu; once you’ve got your serving, squeeze a lime over it and add a dash of chilli flakes for an extra kick.
